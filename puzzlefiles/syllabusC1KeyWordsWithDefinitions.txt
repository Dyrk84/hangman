test suite | A set of test scripts or test procedures to be executed in a specific test run
testing | The process consisting of all lifecycle activities, both static and dynamic, concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of a component or system and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements, to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects
testware | Work products produced during the test process for use in planning, designing, executing, evaluating and reporting on testing
traceability | The degree to which a relationship can be established between two or more work products
validation | Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled
verification | Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled
